    "This assignment transitions you from NumPy's numerical array operations to Pandas' powerful tabular data manipulation. While NumPy excels at homogeneous numerical arrays, Pandas is designed for the heterogeneous, labeled data that characterizes most real-world datasets—mixing dates, categories, numbers, and text within the same table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work with real bike share data from Chicago's Divvy system to answer questions about urban transportation patterns. Through three progressively complex problems—exploring usage patterns, analyzing rider behavior, and conducting temporal analysis—you'll discover why Pandas has become the standard tool for data analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment emphasizes Pandas' design philosophy: named column access, explicit indexing methods (loc/iloc), handling missing data, and method chaining for readable data pipelines. You'll also see how Pandas builds on NumPy while adding the structure and convenience needed for practical data science work.\n",

    "2. I think the stations IDs are a random and unique code that serves as the 'fingerprint' for each location. Each station has a unique code.\n",
    "3. Method chaining is using more than one method for an operation, like doing more than one step at a time. df.isna().sum() identifies the Nan values first and then it adds the total number of Nan values in the column, so we are doing two operations in one. The output of the first one is directly the input of the next one.\n",
    "4. Because the bikes will always have coordinates (its location) but maybe this location is not in any assigned station so it puts missing value in the station column. I would create an extra location that could be something like 'missing bikes', that tells us that these bikes are not in a designated station and that some worker should go pick them up."
